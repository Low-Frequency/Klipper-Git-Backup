# DISCLAIMER

**This version is under development and does not work in the current state!**

## What can you expect of the new version?

The new version will have a UI similar to KIAUH. Also the generation of the config and the installation process will be reworked completely.

Due to the UI the configuration will take place before the actual install. You can preview the configuration at any point from the main menu.

Here's a preview if you're curious:

As a side effect the install script can be used to edit the config file if you want to make some changes to it.

Also there's now only one custom command: `backup`

The main part of coding is done. All that is left is testing if the rework broke any of the existing code (Which I hope it didn't).

Google Drive support has now been completely removed from the source code. If there's enough demand, I'll consider adding it again, but for now I'll keep it as it is.

# Adding a Klipper config backup script

This script sets itself up as a service to backup your klipper config files to a GitHub repository. For Google Drive support refer to the last section of this file.

In the version prior to this only a default install of klipper was supported. Now you can use this script with systems that were set up with [KIAUH](https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh) too and it even supports multiple instances of klipper!

If your're migrating from an old version of the script please just set it up from scratch since pretty much everything has changed.

If you have any questions, bug reports or requests feel free to create an issue or DM me on Discord: **Low_Frequency#0831**

# How does it work?

This script runs when your Pi starts, or if configured even on a set timeschedule. It waits for network connection and then pushes a backup to your specified locations. Every action is logged. This way you always know what fails, or has failed in the past.

It even has log rotation implemented, so it doesn't eat up the precious space for your gcodes :wink:

If you want to know what each script does, you can look inside of the manual located inside of the scripts folder.

This script even sets up custom commands for you to use which makes it super easy to backup and restore your configs via the CLI.

# Setup

## Preparations

Create a GitHub account if you want to store your backup there. If not, just use Google Drive.

If you plan to store the backup on GitHub, go ahead and create a new repo.

## Install

To install this script, `SSH` into your Pi and execute the following command:
```shell
wget -qO setup_klipper_backup.sh "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Low-Frequency/klipper_backup_script/main/setup_klipper_backup.sh" && chmod +x setup_klipper_backup.sh && ./setup_klipper_backup.sh
```

Be aware that this script only works correctly if the installed version of `git` is 2.28 or newer. The install script will check that for you and prompt you to install the latest version of `git` from the source. This is done with a separate [git install script](install-git.sh). You can also use this script to update `git` since it won't be updated by `apt` anymore.

Alternatively you can check this with `git --version` and follow this [guide](git-update.md) to update it manually.

## Update

I removed the update script, since it was a pain to track all the versions and make it compatible to every possible version. To update you simply can pull the latest version from the repo with this command:
```shell
git -C "$HOME/scripts/klipper_backup_script" pull
```

## Adding an SSH key to your GitHub account

The setup script tells you to copy a private key and add it to your GitHub account. To do this just navigate to your *profile* -> *settings* -> *SSH and GPG keys*, add a new key and paste the copied key.

## Making manual backups

To manually create a backup just execute the following command that is created during install:
```shell
backup
```

## Editing the config file

You can customzie how long the log files will be stored, add a backup location and pretty much everything the setup script has asked you during the install.

To customize this, open the config file:
```shell
nano ~/.config/klipper_backup_script/backup.cfg
```

In this file there are all customizable features.

If you want to disable the log rotation completely, just set the `ROTATION` variable to `0`.

To change the log retention time, just change the `RETENTION` variable. Note that the time is calculated in months.

Enabling or disabling backup locations is done via the `GIT` and `CLOUD` variables.

If you want to customize the backup schedule, edit the following variables:

`INTERVAL`: Enable/disable backup schedule.

`TIME`: The schedule interval time.

`UNIT`: The time unit for the interval.

Changing the variables below the marked section is not advised unless you know what you're doing.

## Restoring the config

The script sets up a custom command for this.

If you need to restore your config files just execute the following command and follow the instructions to choose from the availabe options:
```shell
restore
```

## Uninstalling the automatic backup utility

I don't know why you wouldn't want to use automatic backups, but I might as well provide you with an easy way to revert all the changes the scripts have done. Just execute this custom command:
```shell
uninstall_bak_util
```

You still have to manually delete your GitHub repo and the SSH keys though.

To delete the SSH keys, just execute this command:
```shell
rm -r ~/.ssh/github_id_rsa*
```

Don't forget to delete the public key in your GitHub profile too!

## Google Drive support

Google drive support has been disabled due to some changes in the setup of rclone. You can still try to use it, but you have to manually set it up and edit the config file with the respective options (the code for Google Drive backups is still there). But be aware that this is untested in the current version and I might deny support (depending on the issue) when things go wrong.
