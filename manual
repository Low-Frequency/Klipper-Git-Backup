1. install.sh

This is the script for the initial setup. It is called directly from GitHub
during the install. You shouldn't have to execute this manually and it might
break the backup utility if it is run multiple times.


2. klipper_config_git_backup.sh

This is the main script. It is run after every reboot of your Raspberry Pi,
imports the config file and pushes a backup to your specified locations.
You can manually back up your klipper config with the command mentioned in
the overview.


3. restore_config.sh

If something catastrophically fails, you want this script. It guides you
through the restore process for your klipper config.
This script also relies on the config file to know which backup locations
are available. To start the restoring process just execute the command
mentioned in the overview.


4. uninstall.sh

Pretty self explanatory. This script completely uninstalls the klipper backup
utility from your system.
To do this, execute the command mentioned in the overview.

Be aware, that you still have to manually delete your SSH keys after the backup
utility has been uninstalled.
To delete the keys, execute this command:

rm -r ~/.ssh/github_id_rsa*

Don't forget to delete the public key in your GitHub profile too!
